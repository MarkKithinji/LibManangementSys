Library Management System Project.

the project is geared to improve my skills in PHP and using the XAMPP database.

The project entails a login/sign up page linked to a Library Students XAMPP database. LIbrarians can log in too through the page. 
the Librarian has the power to add a book title, its rating, author and its IMAGE(i really struggled to add this, so it gotta be in caps(smiley emoji)).

the student's website is sort of suspended coz i think i prefer nosql (I moved to MongoDB) and i want to focus on a thing at a time.
